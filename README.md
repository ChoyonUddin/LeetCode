LeetCode Questions
Pretty much what the repo name is, just leetcode questions and interview questions that I have completed, attempted, or am completing. 
All solutions are mine own solutions unless specified (which is most likely never the case). Often revist old questions to improve upon efficiency.
The main goal is to really practice more of my coding skills and also get more familiar with github and git. 
I'll probably add some other neet things if I can come up with anything and yeah that pretty much it
