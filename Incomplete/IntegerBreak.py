#343. Integer Break 
#Difficulty: Medium

#Description: Given an integer n, break it into the sum of k positive integers, where k >= 2,
#and maximize the product of those integers.

#Return the maximum product you can get.

#Progress: Under Development 

#Note: this one actually shouldn't be that hard, theres a formula for this and all you have to do is implement it
